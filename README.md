## Features

### 1. **User-Friendly Interface**

- Simple and intuitive design, making it easy to perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Buttons are arranged systematically for quick access.

### 2. **Responsive Layout**

- The calculator uses a grid layout that adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 3. **Dynamic Scrolling Title**

- The calculator features a scrolling title using the `<marquee>` tag, adding a touch of animation to the interface.

### 4. **Interactive Buttons**

- Each button has hover and active effects for a responsive and interactive user experience.

## Technical Overview

### HTML Structure

The HTML provides the structural foundation of the calculator:

- **Input Field**: Displays the current input and results.
- **Buttons**: Arranged for numbers, operators, and utility functions like clear and equals.
- **Marquee Tag**: Displays a dynamic scrolling "Calculator" title.

### CSS Styling

The design leverages modern CSS features for a polished look:

- **Grid Layout**: The `grid-template-columns` property ensures a neat arrangement of buttons.
- **Styling Effects**:
  - Buttons have smooth hover transitions.
  - Box shadows and rounded corners create a professional appearance.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout scales well across devices.

### JavaScript Functionality

JavaScript handles all interactivity and calculations:

- **Input Handling**: Numbers and operators are appended to the display when clicked.
- **Evaluation**:
  - The `eval()` function processes the mathematical expression and returns the result.
  - Example: Input `"2 + 3 * 4"` evaluates to `14` (follows operator precedence).
- **Clear Functionality**: Clears the input field with a single button click.
- **Error Handling**: Displays "Arithmetic Error" for invalid expressions.

## How It Works

### Grid Layout for Buttons

The calculatorâ€™s buttons are arranged using a CSS grid:

- `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr)` divides the layout into four equal columns.
- This ensures consistent alignment of buttons and input fields.

### `eval()` for Calculations

The `eval()` function dynamically evaluates a string-based mathematical expression. While efficient, it should be used cautiously due to potential security risks in production environments.

### Interactive Feedback

Buttons respond to user actions with:

- **Hover Effects**: Change background color for visual feedback.
- **Active States**: Simulate button presses with darker shades.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository using the command below:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/balajis183/arithmetic-calculator.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd arithmetic-calculator
    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

4. Use the calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
   - 4a. Use the buttons to enter numbers and operators.
   - 4b. Click `=` to get the result, or `C` to clear the input.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Theming**: Add light and dark mode options.
- **Keyboard Support**: Allow users to use their keyboard for inputs.
- **Advanced Features**: Include scientific calculator functions like square roots and percentages.
- **Modern Animation**: Replace the `<marquee>` tag with CSS animations for a more modern look.
